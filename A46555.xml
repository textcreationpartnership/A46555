            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Office of Poſt-Maſter General hath beén Erected by Act of Parliament in the Twelfth year of His late Majeſties Reign, and the well Ordering thereof is thereby Declared to be a Matter of General Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of great Advantage, as well for Preſervation of Trade and Commerce as otherwiſe: And whereas alſo the greateſt part of the Revenue and Profits thereby ariſing, was by One other Act of Parliament in the Fifteenth year of His ſaid late Majeſties Reign Granted, and Aſſigned by His late Majeſty unto Vs, by the Name of His moſt Entirely Beloved Brother <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> For and towards Our Maintenance and Support. And whereas by One other Act of Parliament made in the Firſt Year of Our Reign, the Profits and Revenue of the ſaid Office was Settled upon Vs, Our Heirs and Succeſſors; VVhich Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes notwithſtanding, ſeveral Perſons for their private Lucre have lately practiſed, and do ſtill continue in a ſecret and moſt Vnlawful manner to make a General Collection of Letters, and to give them Conveyance and Delivery for Hire, without any Authority from the Poſt-Maſter General, whereby not onely the Revenue ariſing by the ſaid Office is Diminiſhed, but likewiſe ſeveral Dangerous Correſpondencies are Preſerved and Maintained, and the Seditious Deſigns of many Evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Perſons are very much Promoted: His Majeſty therefore for the Prevention hereof in time to come, and to the end that ſuch Perſons who ſhall preſume hereafter to Offend in like manner, may remain without all Excuſe, hath thought fit by this His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proclamation to Require and Enjoyn all His Loving Subjects, And doth hereby ſtraitly Charge and Command all and every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Perſons (other then the Poſt-Maſter General for the time being, his Deputies or Aſſigns) that they preſume not either directly or indirectly to ſet up any Office, or to contrive or practiſe any way or means for Collecting and Receiving of Letters and Packets, or to Carry, Recarry, or Deliver the ſame with Speed and for Hire. And to this end His Majeſty doth further Require and Command them and every of them, That they preſume not to ſet up any Foot-Poſt, Horſe-Poſt, Poſt or Stage-Coach, or Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Boat for Carrying or Recarrying of Letters and Packets, or to Employ or make uſe of any which ſhall be ſet up for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, other then ſuch as ſhall be Licenſed and Authorized by the Poſt-Masſter General for the time being, his Deputies or Aſſigns. And becauſe ſeveral Carriers, Drivers of Stage Coaches and Waggons, Haglers, Maſters of Ships, Purſers, or other Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, do very often, under colour and pretence of their reſpective Employments, intermeddle with, and intrude upon the Office of the Poſt-Maſter General; His Majeſty doth hereby more particularly and expreſly Charge and Command all Carriers, That they preſume not to carry any Letters, other then ſuch as ſhall concern the Goods wherewith they are Charged, beyond the Firſt Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage to which they ſhall arrive, and that they preſume not to outgo their Packs or VVaggons, or deliver any Letters which they Carry, ſooner or with more ſpeed than their reſpective Packs or VVaggons ſhall arrive. And His Majeſty doth in like manner Charge and Command all Drivers of Stage-Coaches, Haglers, and ſuch like Perſons, That they preſume not in any kind, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any pretence whatſoever, to intermeddle with the Conveyance and Delivery of any Letters as aforeſaid, but that they do from time to time refuſe all ſuch Letters which ſhall be ſo tendred to them. And His Majeſty doth alſo Command all Maſters of Ships, Bourſers and Mariners, That they preſume not to Carry any Ship-Letters, other than the Letters of Merchants, Owners, and Maſters beyond the firſt Poſt-ſtage to whsch they ſhall arrive in <hi>England,</hi> and that they do there deliver the ſame unto the Deputy or Deputies onely of the Poſt-Maſter General for the time being. And if any Carriers, Drivers of Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coaches, Haglers, Maſters of Ships, Purſers, or other Mariners ſhall be found carrying of Letters unlawfully, or in any other manner, they ſhall incur His Majeſties high Diſpleaſure, and ſuffer the utmoſt Penalty which can be Inflicted upon ſuch as ſhall be found to have broken His Majeſties Laws, and to be VVilful Contemners of His Royal Command; And moreover, all Letters whatſoever ſent or conveyed by ſuch Clandeſtine and Indirect ways, and by perſons not Lawfully Authorized, ſhall be look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Letters of dangerous Conſequence, and ſhall accordingly be Seized and brought to One of His Majeſties Principal Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, or to ſome One or more of the Lords of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council, to the end the ſame may be Opened and Inſpected, and the perſons Conveying or Sending them, may be proceeded againſt according to Law. And for the better Execution of His Majeſties Command, and as a means to Secure the Revenue ariſing by the ſaid Office, His Majeſty will cauſe ſuch Searchers, Waiters, and other Officers to be Appointed in all convenient Places, as may be fit and proper for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſuch Practices, and carrying ſuch Letters, to be Seized, and ſuch Offenders Names to be certified. And in the mean time His Majeſty doth ſtrictly Charge and Command all Mayors, Sheriffs, Iuſtices of Peace, Conſtables, Bayliffs, Searchers of His Majeſties Ports, and all other His Officers and Miniſters whatſoever within their ſeveral Iurisdictions and Offices from time to time, to make diligent Search for all Mails, Buggets and Bags, in any Ship, Veſſel, VVaggon, Coach, or other Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or Vnlicenſed Carriage, and all ſuch Letters which they find to be Conveyed or Carried contrary to Law, to Seize and ſend up to One of His Majeſties Principal Secretaries of State, or to ſome One or more of the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, together with the Names of the Perſons Offending, to the end ſuch further Proceeding may be had, as ſhall be found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. And that no man hereafter may complain for want of a Settled Poſt in or near particular By-Towns or Places lying on the Poſt-Road, which Complaint hath hitherto been made the Excuſe or Pretence for Sending or Carrying of Letters by other Indirect and Vnlawful Conveyances. His Majeſty doth hereby alſo Require and Command the Poſt-Maſter General for the time being, to take effectual Care for the Conveyance of all By-Letters, by Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Correſpondencies at the leaſt Charge, and greateſt Eaſe that may be to the Countrey, in all conſiderable Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Towns with the next adjacent Poſt-ſtages; And that he cauſe a Map or Card thereof to be forthwith Printed, to the end that all His Majeſties Subjects may know where, and to what place to addreſs their reſpective Letters. And His Majeſty doth further Charge and Command all and every Perſon or Perſons, other then the Poſt-Maſter General for the time being, His Deputies, or Aſſigns, That they preſume not to prepare or provide any Horſes or Furnitures to Let to Hire, unto, or in all or any the Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Poſts, and Perſons Riding Poſt by Commiſſion or without, to and from all and every the Parts and Places of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> where any Poſt-Roads are or ſhall be Settled and Eſtabliſhed, unleſs the Poſt-Maſter General, his Deputies or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſhall firſt fail to Provide and Furniſh the Perſon or Perſons ſo Riding Poſt, with ſufficient horſes and Furniture within the ſpace of Half an Hour after Demand thereof made, as they will anſwer the contrary at their Perils.</p>
